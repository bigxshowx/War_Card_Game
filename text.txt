testing


Dear Yoshino san - This is Anthony Randazzo, thank you for your time earlier today with myself and Laurent Serena.  As discussed, our current company will be dissolved shortly so we are inquiring about switching our current employment contracts and work-visa to Laurent's own 合同会社 or would it be better to create a new entity for this purpose?  

As mentioned, the initial business will be in development and the revenues will be slow.  This is why we would like to understand what the requirements would be for the minimum salary necessary for local social insurances (etc. etc.) and renew our visa sponsored with the new company.
